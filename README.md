# Overview

This software as a ROS package file is meant to send commands to the ROS server from the python file. This python file recieves
bluetooth bits and sends these to the ROS server. The ROS Server publishes these commands and the arduino receives the published commands.

My purpose for creating this is to progress the big project of my robot. It's a big part of being a remote control for my project.

# Development Environment

The tools I used are git, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, ROS SDK - Noetic, Ubuntu 20.04, python 3.9

The programming language I used for this was Python for the file that is sending commands to the ROS Server, and using CPP or the arduino code to recieve the commands.
